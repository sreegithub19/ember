# Ember Example

This directory is a brief example of an [Ember](https://emberjs.com/) app that can be deployed to Vercel with zero configuration.

## Deploy Your Own

Deploy your own Ember project with Vercel.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/vercel/vercel/tree/main/examples/ember&template=ember)

_Live Example: https://ember-template.vercel.app_

### How We Created This Example

To get started with Ember for deployment with Vercel, you can use the [Ember CLI](https://ember-cli.com/) to initialize the project:

```shell
$ npx ember-cli new ember-project

To run the app:
- nvm use 14.0.0
- yarn install
- yarn run start


- Git: git add . && git commit -m "C" && git push origin main
- Vercel: vercel --prod  (this step is not required)


```
